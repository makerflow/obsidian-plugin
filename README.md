# Makerflow Obsidian Plugin
###### Pomodoro timer and distraction blocker for Obsidian

The Makerflow Obsidian plugin helps you get in the zone and stay focused by blocking 
distractions and helping you track your progress.

You can start a timed or untimed focused work sessions by triggering Flow Mode by either clicking
on the status bar icon or executing the "Toggle Flow Mode" command.

Flow Mode can also be setup to automatically start when you have been active in Obsidian 
for a certain amount of time.

It integrates with the Zen plugin to clear distracting elements from the Obsidian UI.

Coming soon: Connect with the Makerflow web app to block distracting websites and apps, and
update your Slack status when you are in Flow Mode.
